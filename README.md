# 🧠 Fetching Best LLM for CV Parsing

## 📌 Task Overview

As part of the **CV Parser Optimization Project**, this task focuses on identifying and benchmarking various open-source language models (LLMs) to determine the most suitable options for extracting relevant information from resumes. The models are evaluated based on three core criteria:

* ✅ **Format Compatibility**
* 💰 **Cost Efficiency**
* ⏱️ **Time Efficiency**
